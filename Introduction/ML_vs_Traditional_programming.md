- Traditional programs take data as input and process it according to predefined logic/rules mainly conditional statements and then provide the output 

- Machine Learning models train themselves on training data Learns from it and generates a solution 

- Traditional programming is a fixed approach where a programmer designs solutions explicitly for a specific problem, where as machine learning models are more flexible, as they can provide solution to a wider range of problems. 

## When should you prefer an ML based solution over a traditional one?

- Traditional programming is suitable for problems where the rules or logic are straightforward and can be explicitly defined. For instance, simple calculations or data transformations where the rules are clear and unchanging.

- Machine Learning solutions are ideal for problems with complex patterns or interactions that are difficult to specify manually. For example, recognizing faces in photos or understanding natural language, where the patterns are too intricate for explicit rule-based programming

Choosing between traditional programming and machine learning depends on the complexity of the problem, the nature of the data, and the need for adaptability. Understanding the strengths and limitations of each approach will help in making an informed decision.
