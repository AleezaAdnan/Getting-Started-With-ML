## Getting Started

*Learning in any process by which a system improves performance from experience*  
— Herbert Simon

Let's start from the very beginning.

### What is Machine Learning?

It's the study of algorithms that learn from the data they are trained on and use this knowledge to make predictions or decisions on unseen data. Instead of being explicitly programmed with specific instructions, these algorithms adapt and improve their performance based on the patterns they identify in the data.

### Some Buzz Words

Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Deep Learning—these are some of the most commonly used terms. So, what's the difference between the three of them?

The diagram below will help you understand better.

#### What's the Differentiating Factor?

**Artificial Intelligence**  
AI is a broader term that covers fundamental techniques to imitate intelligence, to more specialized models such as ML and DL. It ranges from playing chess to recognizing speech and so on.

**Machine Learning**  
ML is a subset of Artificial Intelligence that uses data to train algorithms for making decisions. It essentially recognizes patterns in data.

**Deep Learning**  
DL is a specialization of Machine Learning. DL algorithms have the added ability to learn important features from data by themselves.

### Example: Movie Recommendation System
To make it clearer, let's use an example of recommending movies.

- AI could use any method to recommend movies, from simple rule-based systems to advanced learning models. For example, an AI system might recommend movies based on genres you have previously watched.

- With ML, you train a model using data about users' movie preferences. The model learns to recognize patterns, such as the types of movies you like based on your past ratings and viewing history. For instance, if you often watch and rate sci-fi movies highly, the system will recommend more sci-fi movies to you.

- With DL, you use a neural network that automatically learns features from the data. You give it raw data about movies and user preferences, and it figures out complex patterns on its own. For example, a deep learning model might learn to recommend movies by understanding intricate relationships between genres, directors, actors, and even viewing habits over time, providing highly accurate and personalized recommendations without needing explicit rules.
