## Getting Started

*Learning in any process by which a system improves performance from experience*  
— Herbert Simon

Let's start from the very beginning.

### What is Machine Learning?

It's the study of algorithms that learn from the data they are trained on and use this knowledge to make predictions or decisions on unseen data. Instead of being explicitly programmed with specific instructions, these algorithms adapt and improve their performance based on the patterns they identify in the data.

### Some Buzz Words

Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Deep Learning—these are some of the most commonly used terms. So, what's the difference between the three of them?

The diagram below will help you understand better.

#### What's the Differentiating Factor?

**Artificial Intelligence**  
AI is a broader term that covers fundamental techniques to imitate intelligence, to more specialized models such as ML and DL. It ranges from playing chess to recognizing speech and so on.

**Machine Learning**  
ML is a subset of Artificial Intelligence that uses data to train algorithms for making decisions. It essentially recognizes patterns in data.

**Deep Learning**  
DL is a specialization of Machine Learning. DL algorithms have the added ability to learn important features from data by themselves.

### Example: Handwritten Digit Recognition

To make it clearer, let's use an example of recognizing handwritten digits (0-9) from images.

**AI Approach:**  
AI could use any method to recognize digits, from simple rules to advanced learning models.

**ML Approach:**  
With ML, you train a model using labeled images of digits. The model learns to recognize patterns, like loops and lines, and uses these patterns to identify new, unseen digits.

**DL Approach:**  
With DL, you use a neural network that automatically learns features from the images. You give it raw pixel data, and it figures out the important patterns on its own, making it extremely good at recognizing digits without needing explicit instructions.
