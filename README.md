# Getting-Started-With-ML
Welcome to my machine learning journey! This repository is a collection of what I've learned about ML—from the basics to advanced topics like neural networks and reinforcement learning. It’s a personal guide meant to share insights, algorithms, and resources that have helped me along the way.

## Structure

- **Introduction**: Understanding machine learning and how it differs from traditional programming, the nature of problems that require ML based solutions 
- **Understanding Data**: Types of data (numerical, categorical, graphical) and how to treat each of them.
- **Preprocessing**: Data cleaning, transformation, and feature engineering.
- **Core Learning Algorithms**: Popular algorithms for regression, classification, clustering, and reinforcement learning.
- **Supervised Learning**: Core algorithms and techniques for supervised learning.
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Core algorithms and techniques for unsupervised learning.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: An introduction to reinforcement learning concepts.
- **Neural Networks**: Basics and advanced topics in neural networks.

## Tools and Libraries

In this repository, I'll be primarily using the following tools for building models:

- **Scikit-learn**: For core algorithms in supervised and unsupervised learning. Scikit-learn is ideal for understanding how different models work on various datasets without adding complexity. It offers a simple and consistent API, which makes it perfect for beginners and for educational purposes.

- **TensorFlow**: For neural networks and reinforcement learning. TensorFlow is more suitable for advanced models due to its flexibility and ability to handle large-scale, complex computations. It allows for building and training deep learning models, which are essential for more sophisticated machine learning tasks.

These tools are widely used in the industry and have extensive documentation and community support, making them ideal for both beginners and advanced practitioners.
