# Fine Tuning Your Model

Fine-tuning refers to the process of making adjustments to a model to enhance its performance. This can involve tweaking hyperparameters, modifying the architecture, or even continuing training on new data. Fine-tuning is crucial when:

- Improving Generalization: Avoiding overfitting or underfitting by adjusting the modelâ€™s complexity.
- Optimizing Performance: Getting the best possible accuracy, precision, recall, or other relevant metrics.
- Adapting to New Data: When the data distribution shifts or when new data is added.

## Key Concepts

This directory covers explainations and code snippets related to following fine tuning techniques

1. **Hyper Parameter Tuning**
- Learn how to systematically search for the best settings for your model.
- Use of methods like Grid Search and Random Search.

2. **Regularization Techniques**
- Discover how to prevent your model from overfitting.
- Use of methods like L1/L2 regularization, dropout, and early stopping.

3. **Learning Rate Adjustment**
- Understand the importance of the learning rate and how to adjust it during training.
- Useing learning rate schedules to fine-tune the training process.
