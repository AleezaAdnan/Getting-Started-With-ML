# Fine Tuning Your Model

Fine-tuning refers to the process of making adjustments to a model to enhance its performance. This can involve tweaking hyperparameters, modifying the architecture, or even continuing training on new data. Fine-tuning is crucial when:

- Improving Generalization: Avoiding overfitting or underfitting by adjusting the modelâ€™s complexity.
- Optimizing Performance: Getting the best possible accuracy, precision, recall, or other relevant metrics.
- Adapting to New Data: When the data distribution shifts or when new data is added.

## Key Terms Explained

**Overfitting** Overfitting occurs when a model learns the details and noise in the training data to the extent that it negatively impacts its performance on new, unseen data. The model performs well on the training set but poorly on the test set. In simpler terms, the model memorizes the data instead of learning underlying patterns Overfitting can be mitigated through techniques like regularization, cross-validation, and simplifying the model.

**Underfitting**
Underfitting happens when a model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns in the data. As a result, it performs poorly on both the training and test sets. Underfitting can be addressed by increasing the model complexity, adding features, or using more sophisticated algorithms.

**Bias**
The error from a model being too simple and not capturing the underlying patterns in the data. High bias leads to underfitting.

**Variance**
The error from a model being too complex and sensitive to small fluctuations in the training data. High variance leads to overfitting.

**Bias-Variance Trade-Off**
The balance between bias and variance that helps in finding a model that generalizes well. The goal is to minimize both to achieve better performance on unseen data.

**Cross-Validation**
Cross-validation is a technique used to assess how the results of a statistical analysis will generalize to an independent data set. It involves partitioning the data into multiple subsets (folds) and training the model on some of these folds while validating it on the remaining folds. This helps in estimating the model's performance and avoiding overfitting by ensuring it performs well on different subsets of data.
