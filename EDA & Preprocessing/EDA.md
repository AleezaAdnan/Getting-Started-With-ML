EDA

When you first hear the term EDA, you might think welp another jargon I need to study about but do not panick, we have you covered. 

Imagine your wolf pack decides to watch a movie you haven’t heard of.There is absolutely no debate about that,it will lead to a state where you find yourself puzzled with lot of questions which needs to be answered in order to make a decision.Being a good chieftain the first question you would ask, what is the cast and crew of the movie?As a regular practice,you would also watch the trailer of the movie on YouTube.Furthermore,you’d find out ratings and reviews the movie has received from the audience.

Whatever investigating measures you would take before finally buying popcorn for your clan in theater,is nothing but what data scientists in their lingo call ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’.
Now you think fine Exploratory Data Analysis but what does that mean? Not to worry, as the name indicates it's exploring the data which involves studying, and visualizing information to derive important insights. To find patterns, trends, and relationships in the data, it makes use of statistical tools and visualizations. This helps to formulate hypotheses and direct additional investigations as discussed in the earlier analogy.
